      In Saib -e-Tabrizi’s “Kabul”, the speaker expresses his or her discoveries of Kabul, a city in Afghanistan. Saib-e-Tabrizi uses poetic devices such as personification, imagery, and tone to convey the speaker’s discoveries. 
      Several times in the poem, Kabul is personified: “Her gusts of powdered soil, slightly sting my eyes/But I love her, for knowing and loving are born of this same dust.” Kabul is described as hurting the speaker’s eyes with sand and dust. Through this personification, the speaker discovers that although it has a hostile environment, Kabul is still a place of love and knowledge. Kabul is also personified in the second to last stanza: “Her laughter of mornings has the gaiety of flowers.” This personification describes Kabul as pleasantly laughing, and shows that the speaker has discovered the city as being a lovely, living person. Both instances of personification reveal that the speaker talks about Kabul as he or she would talk about a lover.
      Salib-e-Tabrizi also uses imagery throughout the poem to portray the speaker’s findings. For example, the poet writes “How sparkling the water flows…” and “Her melodious nightingales, with passion sing their songs.” These vivid images of sight and sound solidify Kabul’s beauty. The speaker uses them to help the reader create a concrete idea of the city’s wonders.
      In addition to imagery and personification, “Kabul” also uses tone to reinforce the speaker’s discoveries: “ Khizr chose the path to Kabul in order to reach Paradise.” This quote emphasizes the biblical significance of Kabul, setting a reverent tone. This tone shows how the speaker is awestruck and in wonder when seeing the city.
      Saib-e-Tabrizi uses tone, imagery, and personification to portray the speaker’s discovery of Kabul. These poetic devices and effectively show the reader that the speaker views Kabul as not only a city, but vivid, living, lovely place.
